# airTravelProject

## Overview
This project is just a simple HTML/CSS build with a couple of images. This web was designed to practice HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid, and images. 

### Technology Stack
These are the technologies I used in this project to make it what it looks like.

- **HTML**

- **CSS**

- **font-awesome**

### Styling and Layout
This is the styling and layout of the project and everything I used to make it look how I wanted it to look.

- **CSS - In the CSS I made it so everything has a box-sizing of border-box, margin of 0, and padding of 0. For the body we used Open Sans or sans-serif. For the list styling we used none, for the link's text decoration we also used none and made the color #333. For the container we gave it a max-width of 1240px, margin: auto, and a padding of 0 8 px. For the fa-solid we gave it a font-weight of 900. We made the title bar look presentable, a navbar that looks presentable, a sort bar, all of the listings, everything in the featured section, as well as the footer look presentable.**

-**font-awesome - We used font-awesome images because they are very simple and most people can decipher what they mean just by looking at them, we used most of them in the navbar and some in listings and featured section.**

### Project Structure
This is all the files I used and why I used them.

- **index.html - In the index.html file, it consists of all of the containers and boxes for the listings including links to connect itself and the style.css together.**

- **style.css - In the style.css file, it consists of just making everything look presentable and to make sure it's user-friendly and easy to use.**
